This module allows to print checks from OCA payment orders.

On a payment order linked to the payment method **Check Payment Order**, Odoo will generate a PDF file with one page per payment. This report is designed to be printed on check letters. The report is a letter that contains the address of the payee, an introduction sentence, a table that displays the list of the payment lines and the text information of the check.
