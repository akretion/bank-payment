This module allows to print checks from OCA payment orders.

On a payment order linked to the payment method **Check Payment Order**, Odoo will generate a PDF file with one page per payment. This report is designed to be printed on check letters. The report is a letter that contains the address of the payee, an introduction sentence, a table that displays the list of the payment lines and the text information of the check.


**Table of contents**

   :local:

Configuration
=============

Create a payment mode linked to the payment method **Check Payment Order** created by this module.

The information to print on the check (amount, payee, date, city, etc.) is positionned with a millimeter precision. The default position can be modified via an inherit of the method **_check_print_data()** from *account.payment*.

Some configuration parameters for the information to print on the check can be modified via an inherit of the method **_check_print_params()** from *account.payment*.

Usage
=====

This module will display an error message if you confirm a check payment order with payments in a currency other than the company currency.
